= Incomplete Work

I ran out of time to do a binary assembly analysis of the output C and Rust programs.
I still intend to do this in the coming weeks, just for fun!
But unfortunately, despite all the time I spent on coming up with benchmarks, I am not able to identify specific, measurable reasons why Rust programs are _generally_ slower than C programs.
